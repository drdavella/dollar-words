# dollar-words

Just trying to learn some Clojure. Reads an ASCII text file containing newline
separated words, and prints out the "dollar" words. Each letter is assigned a
monetary value: A is $0.01, B is $0.02, etc. Words whose letters sum to $1.00
are dollar words.

This project was created using leiningen.
